Jonu S. HART, LL. D.'‚ Principal of the New

Jersey State Normal School. Price by mail,
post-paid‚ 3150.

r Dr. Hart hasbeen engaged for at least one-third of a century
in the practical duties of the school-roem, and sor years past has
made a speciality os the subjectos which the present volume
treats. He thus brings to his work a full knowledge of the wants -
of both teacher and scholar in this important branch of educa-
tion, and he has spared no pains to make the book entinently
practr'cal and adopted to use in the class-roam, The peculiar
features os the book are apparent, and, we believe, combine all
the elementsof a' popular and successful text-book. The author's
own style of composition, so remarkable forits rhetorical excel·
lence, gives to his work the advantage os being on every page
a model of what it teaches.

The typographical arrangement is such as to please the eye,
and, at the same time, enable the teacher to assign for memoriter
exercises, only the more important rules, definitions, etc, leaving
the argumentative and descriptive portioris to be either com-
mitted to memory, studied in some more general way, or used as
a reading or class exercise, as the teacher may deem most
expedient.

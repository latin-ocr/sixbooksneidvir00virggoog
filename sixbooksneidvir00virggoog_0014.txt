LIFE OF VIRGIL.

Pnnnrns Vnaernrns Maro (sor so. and not Viryitiar, the best
MSS. give his name) was 'born at Andes, a little village about
three miles below Mantua, on the 15th Oet, B. O. 70. His
father, a comfortable farmer, spared no pains to give his son
a liberal Greek and Latin education, sending him to school st
Cremona, and, after he had assumed the manly gown at the
beginning of his sixteenth year, to Milan, and finally to Naples,
where he was instrueted by the poet and philosopher Parthe-
nius. After several years' residence at Naples, Virgil betook

In this period he wrote a number of short poema, some of which
may have descended to our times; although the authenticityof
the minor poems ascribed to virgil is doubtful. In the year
42 he began to write his Bucolica, to which the name Ecloyuea
was afterwards given by the critics. These are short pastoral
poems, ten in number, and were probably all written before the
year 37. They at once attracted attention and gained him fame
and friends. Some lines from them being recited on the stage,
when Virgil happened once to be in the theatro, the whole
audience rose to do him honor. Their merit consiste in their
versification, which was smoother and more polished than the
hexameters which the Romans had yet seen, and in many nat-
ural and simple touches. John Dryden, in the Dedication of
his translation of the “Pastoralsss' says: “ [Virgil] found the
strength of his genius betimes, and was, oren in his youth, pre-
luding to his Georgica and'his edenda. He could not forbear
to try his wings, though his pinions were not hardened to main-

the soene before our oyes-therontis. Virgil’s conception os the four
infernal rivers is confused. He eonduets Aeneas over a river, vhioh,
aster being called Acheron or Cocytus here, turns out erentually to be
Styx (385). The notion of a single river oi daath was found most oon-
venient for poetionl purposes, but Virgil wished to introduce the various
points of the legends ho followed, and so ha employed tha three names,
with a dim eonoeption os Aeheron aa emptying itsslf into Cocytus, and
perhaps os Styx as themost inward of the three, andaeloarone ol Phle-
gitthon as speeinlly surrounding Tartirus. [From (t-(looyto eruo·

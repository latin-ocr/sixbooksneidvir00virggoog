VL synnssh or synaeresis.

Synizisis (or synaeresis) occurs in Virgil much less frequently
then in the earlier Roman poets. Except in proper names, he
uses it chiefly with ee (as in the different forms ottho verb deesse),
ci (cs ferrei, anteirent), eo (as atreo, careo); seldom with oc (ss
carco, ocreas).

The ancient grammariane referred to synizesis the ceses where
isnd a pcss over into the consonante j ando (pronounced like the
English y and w) and lengthcn the preceding syllable: e. g. par·
jericus, hbjete, maja, flaojoram, ysava, tenve. In the case of verta
the only instances in Virgil are ,precantyb (Aen. VII. 237) and
dsy'ctat (Aen. XI. 890). A contractior of ua occurs in canaam
(Aen. VI. 653), end, according to some editors, in maram (manuam)
Aen. VII. 490.

vn nmen
Tmesis is the separation of the component parts ota componnd
word by an intervening word or words. It moy be resorted to
from metrical consideratione. In Virgil, with the exceptiones
renas and dissyllabic propositione which may be used sdver-
biclly‚ (as saper, circam, end praetem) it occurs only in the separa·

tion of a proposition by an appended ·que from the word ot which
it is a part, e. g. inque salutatam (Aen. IX. 288).

vm hypermeter verses.

Virgil sometimes introduces a line containing n syllable beyond
the number requisite for the metre3 this syllable, however, ends
ln a vowel or in m preceded by a vowel, and is elided before the
initial vowel oi the following line. Such lines are sometimes
effective as denoting that the speaker is carried oa beyond bonnds
by his excitement, or breaks off leaving something still unsaid;

or simply as giving an emphatic ending to the sentence. See
note on Aen. IV. 629 (pege 212) andcf. V11.4rc. In the Georpics 1.

295, the boiling over ol aliquid is described in an hypermeter verse.
Ennius was fond of hypermeter lines; and Virgil may have

used them pertly on account ot their archaic sonnd.

OLASSIOAL VERSIFIOATION.

Ι. Quantity and Accent.

Tan structure of Versa in Latin and Greek, is founded cn the
different quantity of the syllables, as long or short; in English,
on the contrary, and other modern languages, the lawe of versi-
fication refer to the accentaatioa or non-accentuation of the ayl-
lable. Evcn in the prose pronunciation of Greek and Latin, the
occant, while caresully obscrved, was quite subordinate, and is
never named in speaking cf rhetorical euphony‚ while, on tha
other hand, the distinction of quantity was distinctly and strongly
markcd; in poetry, accordingly, the verse was audibly distin·
guishcd by the alternation of the long and short syllables. Aa it
is not possible for us, either in prose or verse, to pronouncc the
words accordingto their quantity with such precision and ia
sach a aoy as the ancients did, we cannot recite their poetry cor-
rectly‚ but are forced to give their verses a certain resemblance
to ours by laying an accent cn the Arsis3 whereas the ancients
simply indicated the arsis by the lecytb of the syllable, not raising
the voice, but only prolonging the sound.

While in the recitation os verse the metricat intonation prc-
dominated, it did not entirely suppress the ordinary accent of
words. Even now a delicate ear can osten feel a subtile beauty
in the relations, in ancient poetry, os the subordinate effccts of
accent with the metricat beat cf the line; and even in English read·

ing of Greek or Latin rerse,the best method combines a primsry

regard sor the rhythm with a certam attentasti tc the asscqcsnt

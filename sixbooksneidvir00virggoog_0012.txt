HE text of the first Six Books 01 the Aeneid here given,
is the same as that in my edition 01 the whole poem.
It is based upon a careful ,0011011οο 01 the editions 01 Heyno,
Wagner, Conington, Ribbeck, and Ladewig, with frequent
reference to other standard authorities, and with constant
and especial regard 10 the testimony of the best manuscripts.
In the preparation of the Noter, the endeavor has been
made to meet the actual wants of studente in our schools ;
not forgetting that the best help one can give a learner is 10
100011 him 10 help himself. Frequent references are made to
the grammars most in use in this country, and explanations
are furnished 01 passages difficult of interpretation, of peculi·
arities of syntax, and 01 such points of history, geography,
mythology, and antiquities 00 require elucidation. In ths
Vocabulary, which I have prepared at the suggestion of many
experienced and accomplished teachers, it is believed that a
complete statement will be found 01 the Virgilian uses 01 each
word, so far as the first Six Books 01 the Aeneid are con·
oerned. The chief difficulties in scanning are solved in the
Metrical Index; and 10 the Remarks which follow, informa·
tion will be found on some points 01010001001 versification
which are not fully explained in our popular grammars. The
Index 01 Proper Names adds some factsto those stated in the
Notes and Vocabulary3 and beginners may read with profit
the Suggestions 10 Students on the 334th page.
It will be seen that, in addition to the results 01011] own

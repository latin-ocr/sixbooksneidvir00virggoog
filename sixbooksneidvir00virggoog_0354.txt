THE publication of this edition of the Classics was suggested
by the constantly increasing demand by teachers sor an edition
which, by judicious notes, would give to the student the assist-
ance really necessaryto render his study profitable‚ fumishing
explanations oi passages difficult of interpretation, os peculi-
arities of Syntax, dcc„ and yet would require him to make faith-
ful use of his Grammar and Dictionary.

It is believed that this Classical Series needs only to be known
to insure its very general use. The publishers claim for it pe· Α
culiar merit, and beg leave to call attention to the following
important particulars:

Tho purity of tle taxt. Tho tort ir not a maro roprint britia “

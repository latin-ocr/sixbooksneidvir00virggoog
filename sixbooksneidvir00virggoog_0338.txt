IL The Hercle Hexametsr.

Prom its sustained and continuone flovv, the dactylic hexam·
eter is the verse best adapted to a uniformly progressive exhi·
bition of events, and is therefore used in narrative (or epic)
poems, and in didectic poems, satires, and poetical epistles.

ΠΙ. caesura and ‘Gaesmal Panse.

The beauty of an hexameter line depende very much upon the
proper observance of the caesural pause in recitation. The
pause most natural and most common is that in the third fect.
A pause in the fourth, however, is considered as a beauty,
when, at the sometime, there is a less considerable caesura in
the second foot3 e. y.

Italiam Ι fato profugus i Laviniaque venit.

(laesura itself greatly contributes to the euphonic flow of the
verse. The student will grow familiar with its varieties by his
own observation, aided by his grammar. Imay call attention
to the effect of “the seeming contest between the words and the
verse'' which appears in the fect-caesuras in such lines as the
following:

Une sa Ι lus visitis nul Ι lam spe 1 rare sel lutem.

A pauso of sense often determines for us the principat caesura,
to be observed in recitaticn.

The expression of the veracis affected by the place of the
caesura. In general, the earlier caesuras give to the verse more
vivacity; the later, more gravity.

The first fcot of each verse (says W.) is fitted for strong and
emphatic expressions, because at the beginning of a line, when
we have taken a fresh supply of breath, we use a full and povv-
erful voice, which, if not rcused anew, falls away in the middle
aud end of the verse. We must take care, therefore, that we de

not diminish this force of the voice, which would be the result

did we make a pause after the first foot. Sometimes, however,
tha very harshness of the incisiou* in this place lende vigor and
expressiveness to the verse, as rieul. 135, Qrvoe epo; ond IV,

His apic poam, the Aeaeid, had long been meditated. 'l'o its
composition he gave the last eleven years ot his lila; hc pur·

the paem; but ho died without having given it his final touches.
On this account, it is said, he wished, in his last illaesa, to
barn it; hut his friends would not allow him, and it was pre·
served and published, without alteration, by Varius and Plotius.
While composing his apic,Virgil occasionally recited passages
from it to his companions, and the highest expectatione were
‘ raised oi the groatness of the work. (Gt. Propert. Eley. II. 34, aa.)

In the year 23 B. O. died Marcellus, the son of the Emperor’r

wrought over and made his own3 it is the unmistakable air of
Rome that breathes from every page; the stamp ot Virgil is on
the whole work. Again; had Homer himself no modelsl Nay,

“Virgil imitated Homer, but imitated him as a rival, not as a

own, operating in a sphera analogous to his.'’†

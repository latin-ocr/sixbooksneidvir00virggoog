IV. Lengthening 01 aSyssable 1)]110 Aren.

'rho so-celled lengthening by the arsis, reste, es a tolerated
license, ou the circumstance, that in defined places in certain
verses the reader expects and requires 0 lory syllable, and hence if
the poet, within certain limits, ellows himself to use e 01001 000,
10 001 misled by it, but modifies the pronunciation 01 the syllable
in respect 01 the quantity in such 0 way, that the requirements
of the verse ere in a manner satisfied. This liceuse therefore ie

· anelogous to lhe occasiouel accentuation of unaccented syllables
iu modern verse. 1t is 001 frequent, except in the short final
syllable 01 dissyllabic or polysyllabic words ending in a conso-
nent, end especially when the force of the arsis is aided by the
prinoipal caesura 01 the verse. Final syllables ending in evowel
are much less frequently “lengthened'' 1)] the arsis. This
occurs often, however, with the enclitlc que in the second (or

fourth) foot of the hexameter, commonly supported by the
caesura. Short monosyllabic words are never lengthened 1)]

V. Hiatus.

Virgil allows himself au hiatus, (i. 0. forbears to elide a vowel
before another vowel) first, in the arsis of the second, third,
fourth, or fifth foot, especially iu proper names followed 1)] e
mark 01 punctuation or when the seme vowel is the initial 01 the
following word; secondly‚ iu the thesis, when in accordance with
Greek precedente 0 lonyvowel or diphthongis 0100100001, especially
in the case 01 proper names aud interjectione: with short vowels
in the thesis, hiatus occurs only before 0 strong mark of puuc-
tuatiou (09.1θο Ι. 405).

Hiatus in Virgil ie often found in those lines which are formed
on a Greek model, i. 0., those which terminate in 0 quadrisyllable,
(end this, moreover‚ is frequently 01 Greek origin) or which
hare a spondaic endiug. 'lkis is to be attributed to the poet’s

fondness for imitating his great mamere-li. 00111,

une ‘¹ Ae-ne'-id'¹ derives its name from its hero, rte-aeter, aTrojnn
prisce, the son cf Anchises aad Venus. Its subject is his “adven-
tures, while sailing from Troy, alter the destruction os that city, in
search os n setttement,- hisfinnl lendin g in Italy,-and his triumphant
struggle with his enemies and his rival, Turnus, in that country, leav-
ing him free to marry Lavinia, thedaughter of IretInus, king ot the
Latine, and to found Lavinium, the mother city of Rome.'' As a
“ocliant warrior and picae worshippcr of the gods,” Aeneas represents
Virgil’s ideal οἰ the Roman pcople. Indirectly, the object of the [roera
is to gratily the pride of the Romans, to quickeu their patriotism, to
heighten their regard sor religion, end tc exalt their monarch,
Augustus.

“The grand religione idea which brenthos throughout the Aeneid‚”
says Merivale, “is the persuasion that the Romans are the sons and
successors or the Trojcns,·the chosen rane oi heaven, os divine lin'eege
and royol pretensions, whose destinies hnve engaged all the care ol ¹
'olympus from the beginning, till thcy reach nt last their consumma·
tion in the blissiul regeneration os the empire. It maintains the exist-
cnce of Providence as the bond of thc Roman cornmonwealth. ‘Yesl
there are gods,' it proclairns, ‘and the glories ot Rome demonstrate it.”¹

'l'hefirst six books describe the adventures and wanderiugs os Aeneas
before reaching his destined home in Italy, the last six his wars with
Turnus und his allies.

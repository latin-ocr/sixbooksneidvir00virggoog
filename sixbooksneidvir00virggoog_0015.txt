down gently, circling in the air, and singing, to the ground;
like a lark, melodious in her mounting‚ and continuing her
song till she alights‚ still preparing for‘a higher flight at her
next sally, and tuning her voice to better music.''

After the battle of Philippi (B. C. 42) Octavianus assigned to
his soldiers lands in various parts of Italy3 and the neighbor-
hood of Cremona and Mantua (which had adhered to the cause
of Brutus and Cassius) wasone of the districts in which tho sol-
diers were planted, and from which the former possessore were
dislodged. Virgil was thus deprived of his property. Itis
said that it was seized by a reteran named Claudius or Clodius;
that Asinius Pollio, who was then governor of Gallia Transpa-
dana, advised Virgll to apply to Octavianus at Rome for the·
restitution of his land, and that Octavianus granted his request.
It is supposed thatVirgil wrote the Eclogue which stands first
in our editions (but was fourth in the order of composition) to ex·
prese his gratitude to Octavianus Caesar. There is an uncertain
tradition of a subsequent dispossession from his estate, when he
was obliged to fiee before the sword of an angry soldier, andos a
final restoration of his property after the peace of Brundusium.

Virgil gained early the friendship of Maecenas, the confiden-
tial friend and counsellor of Augustus, and the munificent patron ’
ofmen of letters, “whose house, whose table, and whose gar-
dens‚ were the resort of all the wite, virtuosi, actors, joyous
spirits, and agreeable idlers of Rome.” ἥ With the Emperor
Α himself, with Maecenas and Pollio, and with all the members
of the brilliant coterie of men of genius who surrounded tho
court of Augustus. he lived on terms of cordial intimacy. The
successful productione of others affordcd him as much pleasure
ss if they were his own. His large library was open to all men
of learning; and he often quoted the saying of Euripides that
“the property of friends is a common good,'’ (ra rav φίλων κοινά.)

rue most finished work of Virgil, his Georgica, an agricultu-
ral poem, was undertaken at the suggestion ot' Maecenas. Its
object was ‘⁶ to recommend the principles of the ancient Romans,
their love of home, of labor, of piety‚ and order3 to magnify
their domestic happiness and greatness; to make men proud
of their country on better grounds than the mere glory of its
arms and extentos its conquesta. . . . To comprehend the
moral grandeur of the Georgica in point of style the most per-
fect piece of Roman literature, we must regard it as the glori·
fication of Labor.'’† While writing this poem, Virgil composod
many verses in the morning, but by evening reduced them to a
very few; so that he used to compare himself to ebear, which
ticks its shapeless offspring into form.

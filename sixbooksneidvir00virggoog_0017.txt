After finishing the first draft of his epia, Virgil contemplated
a tour in (iresca and Asia, that he might perfect it among the
soenes in which many of its incidente are laid. With a dread
almost prophetie, Horace prays for his sale return, in the beau·
tiful ode addresscd to the ship which bore his departing friend
on his way. At Athens the poet met with Augustus, who was
returningfrom Samos to Rome. Changing hisformer intention,
virgil determined to accompany his patron. 011 a visit to Me·
gara, he was seiaed with a sudden indisposition, which his voy-
age increased‚ and he died a few days after his arrival at Brun·
dudum, on the aad of Sept, B. Ο. 19, in his fifty-first year. In
accordance with his nequest his body was conveyed for burial
to N aples‚ which had been his favorite place of residente, both
ou account of the extreme beauty of tho scenery, and the mild-
ness of the climate, congenial to his delicate health. His tomb
still stands on the hill of Posilipo‚ and is visited by pilgrims
from every land

ln person, Virgil is said to have been tall, aud stoutly made,
of dark complexion, aud with the appearance of a former. He
was slow in speech. and his manners wera shy and of almostfem-
inino modest-y. We are told that he read with great sweetnoss‚
and imparted even to dull matter a charm which gave it a life not
its own. From his asthmatic tendenay, and the weak eyes of
Horace, arose the saying attributed toAugustus‚ that, with these
poets on either hand, he was sitting between sighs and tears.

llis parents lived long enough to enable him to show his affec·
tion and gratitudo by maintaining them in affluenca, his father
having become blind. Donatus rates his fortune at about ten
thousand sestertia, (nearly four hundred thousand (lallare.)
and states that his house at Rome stood on the Esquiline Hill,
near the gardana of Maecenas and the house of Horace.

His fame, which was established in his life-time, was aher·
lshed aster his death, as an inheritanoe in which every Roman
had a share; and his works bacam school-books even before
the death of Angustus, and have continued such ever since. In
the Middlc alges, the belief was prevalent that he had been a
great magioian3 and of his feots most wonderful things were re·
lated. But it neoda not fiction to attest his powers of enohant·
manif for till civilization is no more, successive general-iona of
readers shall confess a genuine magio in the spell cf that

“Splrlt of Mantua,

Of whom the fame still in the world irrideres¹
And shall codonatum-tasting aa tta world!
